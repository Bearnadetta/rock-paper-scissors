When one of the three option blocks is pressed, run the following:
    playerChoice = block, opponentChoice = random 1/3 chance (assigned to block)
    display result in results block
    if playerChoice wins in RPS, increment scoreboard for player. If opponentChoice wins in RPS, increment opponent scoreboard.

    check to see if either player has reached 5 points, if so alert "you win/lose" and reset the game

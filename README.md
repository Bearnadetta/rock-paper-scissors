I've been working on this project for a little over a week, and I've run into a few issues that slowed me down. The biggest thing that I've taken from this project has been a much better understanding of scope.

I wanted the console to log the score of the player and the computer between each round, and I tried a few different solutions to make this happen. My mistakes taught me a lot about the ways in which 'let' differs from 'const', as well as the ways in which I can structure my code to make it work the way I intend.
